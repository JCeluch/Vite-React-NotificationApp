# Notification Management App

This project is a React application built with Vite, TypeScript, and SCSS modules. It features a notification system with different types of notifications, a notification modal, and a global state management system using React Context.

## Features

- **Navbar with Notification Icon**: A bell icon with a counter that displays the number of unread notifications.
- **Notification Modal**: Displays all notifications and unread notifications, with an option to mark all as read.
- **Notification Types**: Supports three types of notifications - Request, Status change to on hold, and New feature.
- **Persistent Notifications**: Notifications are persisted across page reloads using `localStorage`.
- **Notification Interactions**: Notifications are clickable and redirect to different pages. They can also be marked as read individually.
- **Global State Management**: Manages notifications globally using React Context.
